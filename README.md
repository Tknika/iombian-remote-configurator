> ```git clone https://github.com/Tknika/${PROJECT_NAME}.git /tmp/${PROJECT_NAME} && cd /tmp/${PROJECT_NAME}```

- Create the installation folder and move the appropiate files (edit the user):

> ```sudo mkdir /opt/${PROJECT_NAME}```

> ```sudo cp requirements.txt /opt/${PROJECT_NAME}```

> ```sudo cp -r src/* /opt/${PROJECT_NAME}```

> ```sudo cp systemd/${PROJECT_NAME}.service /etc/systemd/system/```

> ```sudo chown -R iompi:iompi /opt/${PROJECT_NAME}```

- Create the virtual environment and install the dependencies:

> ```cd /opt/${PROJECT_NAME}```

> ```python3 -m venv venv```

> ```source venv/bin/activate```

> ```pip install --upgrade pip```

> ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- Start the script

> ```sudo systemctl enable ${PROJECT_NAME}.service && sudo systemctl start ${PROJECT_NAME}.service```

## Docker

To build the docker image, from the cloned repository, execute the `docker build` command in the same level as the Dockerfile.
In this case replace the variables like `${IMAGE_NAME}` with a value.

`docker build -t ${IMAGE_NAME}:${IMAGE_VERSION} .`

For example:
`docker build -t iombian-remote-configurator:latest .`

After building the image, execute it with docker run.

`docker run --name ${CONTAINER_NAME} -e CONFIG_HOST=127.0.0.1 -e CONFIG_PORT=5555 -e LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG iombian-remote-configurator:latest`

- **--name** is used to define the name of the created container.

- **--rm** can be used to delete the container when it stops.
This parameter is optional.

- **-d** is used to run the container detached.
This way the container will run in the background.
This parameter is optional.

- **-e** can be used to define the environment variables:
    - CONFIG_HOST: the host where the service needs to connect to send the configuration values. Default value is "127.0.0.1".
    - CONFIG_PORT: The port where the service needs to connect to send the configuration values.
    Default port is 5555.
    - LOG_LEVEL: define the log level for the python logger.
    This can be NOTSET, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR or CRITICAL.
    Default value is INFO.
